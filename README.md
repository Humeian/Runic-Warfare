# Runic-Warfare

### Setting ###
Runic Warfare is set in a fantasy world where players duel in a magic-inspired arena. Magic plays a key role in this world, and practitioners use Arcane Tablets to channel this latent power. 
The most ambitious of these practitioners, Runic Magi, establish political power and personal glory in spellcasting battles: Runic Duels. Players will play as powerful Runic Magi, using their Arcane Tablets to conjure spells and overcome their opponents.

### Gameplay ###
The game will be a real time combative duel between two players in a closed arena.
Each player must cast spells to defeat the opposing player. To cast a spell, players will draw the glyph associated with that spell on their tablet and swipe upwards diagonally to the right or left to cast in that direction.
There are an arsenal of 7 spells available to cast, that perform different kinds of offensive or defensive abilities. Most spells are also tied to some sort of player movement as well so that you can dodge incoming projectiles if you are quick with your castings.
Players must proactively create their own strategy to attack their opponent, and reactively dodge their opponentâ€™s attacks to gain a competitive edge. 

A full game will consist of up to 5 rounds. To win the match, a player needs to win 3 out of 5 rounds. Each round will have a short timer (around 30-90 seconds) to reflect the fast pace of the game. If the round timer reaches zero before a player is defeated, the player closest to the center of the arena will win the round.
